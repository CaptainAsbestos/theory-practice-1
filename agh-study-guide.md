# Theory & Practice I Study Guide

This guide is a precis of a every week of reading for the semester, covering the key authors and concepts. Also included are questions which might appear on the exam.

## Week 1: Methodology

### Snyder: *One World, Rival Theories* (Essential Readings pp3-15)

Snyder gives an overview of the different theoretical schools within International relations in the english-speaking world. Broadly speaking, he names three:

- **Realism**, considered the oldest, which goes back thousands of years
 - Key Authors:
   - **Thucydides** & Sunzi (aka Sun Tzu) as the founders in the Ancient World
   - **Thomas Hobbes** & Niccolò Machiavelli developed it in the Mediæval Era; Otto von Bismarck perfected after the Napoleonic Wars
   - After the Second World War, **Hans Morgenthau** modernised Realist thinking, and **John Mearsheimer** developed it further
   -  Modern Realists include **Kenneth Waltz**
 - Modern variants include **Structural Realism** (associated with Mearsheimer) and **Neo-Realism** (associated with Morgenthau)


- **Liberalism**, which evolved simultaneously during the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution
 - Founders: Voltaire, John Locke, **Immanuel Kant**, David Ricardo, & Adam Smith are the Founders
 - **Woodrow Wilson**, president of the US during the First World War, is the most preeminent practioner of International Liberalism we have discussed
 - Joseph Nye & **Robert Keohane** are among the leading experts on Liberal Theory today
 - Modern variants include **Neoliberalism** (associated with the likes of Francis Fukuyama) & **Classical Liberalism** (more like Laissez-Faire economics with a night-watchman state)


- **Idealism**, which was developed most recently by synthesizing Post-Modern philosophy, psycho-analysis, and sociology
 - Founding Authors include **Karl Marx** & **Vladimir Lenin**
 - Important 20th Century authors include Antonio Gramsci, Frantz Fanon, Edward Saïd, and Judith Butler
 - Within the Anglosphere, modern idealists include **Martha Finnemore**, **Robert Jervis**, and **Ted Hopf**
 - Modern variants include **Constructivism,** **Historical Materialism**, **Feminism**, & **Environmentalism**


In my opinion, Snyder dumps all the critical (read: *anti-establishment*) theories into the "idealist" category. Most politicians are either realists or liberals, hence the systemic bias towards those schools of thought.

Snyder presents a pair of helpful tables on pp 5 and 9 to illustrate his view of the state of IR. Consider committing these to memory.

A key point which Snyder makes is that Realism & Liberalism are *substantive and all encompassing* theories of international relations, whereas rationalism and constructivism only make *methodological assumptions*. What does that mean? Realists and Liberals presume a certain world in which we live -- either a balance of power, or a confederation of equals -- which necessarily colours their analysis. Constructivists and Rationalists, on the other hand, do not have any assumptions about the international landscape; rather, their assumptions are in how the human mind operates and how society is constructed by individuals.

Snyder remarks that there is a trend towards "eclecticism" in the literature, by which he means that researchers are no longer choosing sides, but using each theory when it best suits their purpose.



#### Questions to consider:

- What are the blind spots of Realism, Liberalism, and Critical Theories? What are they not very good at explaining? Why?
- What kind of world do each of these theories think is "perfect?" How do these theories help "get there?"
- What phenomena in international relations are predicted and explained by each theory?
- How did each of these theories change after the Second World War? How did these theories adapt to 9/11?

### Walt, *Relations between Theory & Policy in IR* (PDF)

Walt discusses the widening gap between IR theory and practice. He argues that academics are more worried about impressing their colleagues than actually solving problems IRL and that Politicians prefer to go with their guts instinct and experience rather than benefit from academic theory.

### Mahoney & Goertz, *Quantitative vs. Qualitative* (PDF)

Check the table on pp 229 **(Table 1)** for a good summary of this paper. Probably best to just study this.

## Week 2: Realism

Realism makes a handful assumptions:

- The world is fundamentally anarchic: there is no single authority forcing states to play nice.
- States are in control of their entire territory or society... or at least, the most successful states are.
- States pursue power through rational decision making, because power = survival.

### Thucydides, *Melian Dialogue* (Essential Readings)

Thucydides was an Athenian who wrote a history of the Peloponnesian War (Memorise the spelling). During the War, his city-state conquered Melos, an island which had no real means to resist. The imaginary dialogue he wrote is between the negotiating sides, where the Athenians tried to persuade the Melians to surrender. Needless to say, they didn't, but the arguments each side makes are interesting to consider.

The Athenians basically argue that "might makes right." If the Melians were in the Athenian position, they would tell Athens to surrender. The strong do what they will, the weak do what they must. The Athenians wanted a bloodless victory, and if they didn't get that, they would make an example out of the Melians.

The Melians argued that they would rather take a million-to-one chance at keeping their independence rather than surrender. They also reminded the invaders that if Melos was not treated fairly, the rest of Greece would hate Athens and turn against them.

After Athens conquered, razed, and looted Melos, the rest of Greece hated them and began to favour their enemy, Sparta. Athens went on to lose the war. Maybe the Athenians weren't thinking realistically after all?

### Hobbes, *Leviathan* (Essential Readings)

Thomas Hobbes lived through the English Civil War, which began when Parliament executed the King and began a war against the Catholic loyalists and Monarchists. Hobbes was a royalist, so naturally he blamed the rabble-rousers for the war, which unleashed untold violence on Merry England. This informed his theory of statehood. Parallel to the English Civil War is the 30 Years War, which raged on the continent of Europe and also involved Catholics and Protestants killing each other over religion. The 30 years war is where we get our notion of **Sovereignty:** You can't just invade your neighbour and kill them because they are a different religion. *Cuius regio, Cuius religio*, in English, "Your house, your rules."

*Leviathan* is what Hobbes calls the ideal state. Everyone should bow down and accept the lord they serve, and they will get what they deserve: peace and security from dangers, foreign and domestic. Anyone who isn't obeying the Leviathan is dangerous, because they weaken the Sovereign Monarch's ability to keep the peace.

Important to remember is that Hobbes's christianity also greatly informed his beliefs. Obeying a King who wields divine authority seemed perfectly natural to him. Secondly, he also wrote that "life is nasty, cruel, brutish, and short" ... anybody with that kind of view of life and human nature is probably going to want Daddy to save him from the evil Roundheads.

### Morgenthau, *Realist Theory* & *The Balance of Power* (Essential Readings)

Skipping ahead 400 years, Hans Morgenthau has fled the Nazis and settled in the US after the Second World War. Most people are convinced that realism as a theory is outdated and dead. They point to how Realist paranoia of thy neighbour took the Balance of Power in Europe (known as the Concert of Europe, formalised after Napoleon was defeated) and produced the most destructive war in human history. Morgenthau disagrees.

Morgenthau's contribution is to *modernise* realism as a theory; stripping it of its religious pretensions and its ancient baggage. Realism was now a scientific theory, based on variables like "power" and "security" and "risk." He argues that a perfect world might be possible, but it can only be realised by working *alongside* human nature, rather than at odds with it. Morgenthau still believes that right and wrong are independent of power, but also that the only justice you get is that which you make yourself. Importantly, citizens don't have an obligation to their government to obey; states have an obligation to their citizens to make sure they are safe and well.

In *The Balance of Power*, Morgenthau describes...the balance of power. This concept describes the ultimate end state of politics: a stable equilibrium between multiple great powers. If any one state becomes too ambitious, the others will ally against them. Crucially, this is not necessarily a *peaceful* world, merely the *least violent* world. He uses 19th century Europe as an example, which was a balance between Britain, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria. These countries enganged in war with each other often, but only in the interest of preserving the balance between them. Morgenthau might argue that Austria's wane destabilised everything, as well as Prussia conquering the rest of Germany and becoming more than a parade ground for battles.

### Mearsheimer: *Anarchy and the Struggle for Great Power*  (Essential Readings)

Mearsheimer wrote this piece in the months leading up to 9/11. He argues agaisnt Morgenthau's Realism, advancing a theory of "offensive realism" to explain state behaviour within the international system.

Mearsheimer thinks that the reason states are so paranoid of one another and maximise power is because the *structure of the international order requires them to be paranoid*. Because there is no higher power above states, and the stakes of the game are kill-or-be-killed, it makes perfect sense that states do not trust each other and seek power. This is anarchy in the oldest sense of the word: not chaos, but a *world without rulers*.

Importantly, states have imperfect information to make their decisions: not just about their enemies, but about their own capabilities. They also want not to *win*, but to survive, or at least see their way of life survive. As a consequence of the structure of the international system, states maximise their power and form alliances when they have to. But this makes their enemies paranoid, who then do the same thing. Inevitably, a 1% chance of war becomes a 99% chance of war: **a security dilemma**.

Defensive realists want to maintain the balance of power at all costs; offensive realists want to change it, or at least push the envelope as far as it can go before somebody stops them. An example of an offensive realist would be Napoleonic France: in order for the French Republic to survive, they had to invade and liberate the rest of Europe, lest the Monarchies of Europe overthrow Napoleon and reinstall the Bourbon King (which is exactly what ended up happening). Mearsheimer would have told Napoleon to settle for being a hegemon within his **sphere of influence**, rather than invade Egypt *and* Russia *and* the New World. According to Mearsheimer, the balance of power is *between* spheres of influence, and powerful enough states can meddle in other spheres at their own risk.

Mearsheimer also warns of situations in which a **revisionist power** seeks to overtake the pre-eminent hegemon (such as Germany overtaking England, or Japan trying to overtake the US -- both in the Second World War). When the pre-eminent power and the revisionist disagree on who should be in charge, catastrophic war is likely.

- What is a security dilemma? What is a historical example?
  - How do you get out of a security dilemma?
- Is power a means to an end? If not, why pursue it?
- What are "relative gains," (in contrast to "absolute gains") and why do realists only care about relative gains (in contrast to liberals)?
- What is an example of "imperfect information?" What kind of states have better information about themselves and their enemies? What kinds of states have the abilities to act on that info effectively?
- Does Might make right? Why or why not? What would each of these Realists authors say?
- Is hegemony a good idea? Why or why not?
- What do realists say human behaviour is like?

## Week 3: Liberalism

Liberalism (the philosophy and IR Theory) developed during the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. Its entry into politics coincided with the entry of the European Middle Class into the politics of their countries as well as bloody wars of colonisation in the Global South.

Liberals believe that the power of reason can be used to improve the world. Thus, they value the freedom of thought, speech, and debate. Most liberals also believe that **capitalism** is the best way to organise human economic activity, using markets and enlightened self-interest to make everybody happier and richer. Back in the 1700s, liberals fought against superstitious religions and feudal despots. They called for natural rights entitled to every (white) man and a government in which the middle class had a say. Over the last 300 years, modernity has gone from a radical revolt against the ancient order to a new kind of dogmatism – and the story of Kant to Fukuyama is how.

Whereas realists cherish sovereignty, liberals cherish **legitimacy**. A state which is illegitimate should not exist, say liberals. Only democracies and republics are legitimate because only they recognise the rights of their citizens in politics. In practice, however, liberal republics were often just as racist and sexist as you'd expect – the French Republic and the United Kingdom both have colonies to this day.

### Immanuel Kant, *Perpetual Peace* (Essential Readings)

Kant lived in Königsberg, Prussia (present day Kaliningrad, and exclave of the Russian Federation on the Baltic coast) during the Enlightenment movement in Europe. Königsberg was part of federation of city-states known as the Hanseatic League; they were a union of trade states which managed the flow of goods from St. Petersburg Russia to Liverpool. They were united together by common enemies: the Russian Empire, the Swedish Empire, the Danish Empire, and the Holy Roman Empire. The Hanseatic states recognised this, and knowing that their trade was what gave them common purpose, they forged an alliance. It was dysfunctional and not a government over any state, but it allowed the Middle Class of each city-state to have a greater say in their politics than if they were part of larger, neighbouring empires. This political environment influenced Kant's philosophy.

Kant is better known as a moral philosopher, inventing concepts such as the "categorical imperative" and stuff. He was a very strict moral absolutist, and believed that by thinking hard enough about any moral problem, you could arrive at an answer that would apply forever and for everywhere. This also influenced his political philosophy.

In *Perpetual Peace*, Kant argues that enlightened states (led by either benevolent, wise kings or a parliament of studious and trustworthy representatives) would recognise that Peace is preferable to war. Through gentlemanly discussion with other states, enlightened governments could decide how best to maintain the peace between them, and punish the states which threaten the peace. Since Kant also believed that the best government is a *just* government, tyrants and despots wouldn't be allowed to join the club.

Kant is important for modern liberalism because he was among the first Europeans to argue that something besides Hobbesian chaos and anarchy was possible, and he gave a roadmap to accomplish it: a *confederation of states*, using their enlightened self interest to improve trade relations between one another. The fear of missing out in dictatorships would make them want to join the liberal club – you can see how this applies to the modern day EU for instance.

Unfortunately, Kant was an inveterate racist, so naturally he would never allow "savage nations" to join the club. Thus begins the long and awkward contradiction of liberals throughout history spreading democracy and free trade at gun point.

### Woodrow Wilson, *The Fourteen Points* (Essential Readings)

Woodrow Wilson was Preisdent of the US during the First World War. Like Kant, he was also a racist and still believed that a confederation of states would be able to create Perepetual Peace. After Germany, Austria, and Turkey surrendered, Wilson travelled to Paris to negotiate the terms of the peace treaty. The Fourteen Points were his plan for creating a long-lasting peace in Europe.

Rather than enumerate all of them, we'll settle for the major themes. First off, he called for the European empires to give up their colonies, which he called **self-determination**. He likely did so because the catalyst for the war was a Serbian Nationalist assassinating his emperor's son – if Austria didn't have colonies, maybe Franz Ferdinand wouldn't have died and triggered the entire war. These new nation-states would necessarily have to be democracies, since democracies don't go to war with each other; Wilson blamed the German's obsession with the Kaiser and the Military over democracy for escalating the war and attacking innocent democracies like the Netherlands. Lastly, he called for the creation of a League of Nations, where every country in the world could solve their problems non-violently. If any country violated the rules of the League, they would be cast out and possibly even invaded.

Wilson's goals were only halfway realised. The Germans, Austrians, and Turks had to give up their empires, but the French and British did not. The League of Nations was created, but the US Congress refused to join it -- ironic. Lastly, the new democracies created ended up being quite dysfunctional and losing legitimacy in the eyes of their citizens. Within 20 years, the Second World War broke out, proving that the League of Nations failed to keep the peace. It's successor organisation, the UN and the UE, have done better (maybe?).

### Neoliberalism

The neoliberal began in the 1970s, when the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union split the communist bloc in two. Economic *globalisation* was beginning, and the US abdicated its role as the centrepiece of the *Bretton Wood* system. The US reached out to the PRC and began to devlop trade relations; the EU was formed just as many former colonies got their independence. By the 1990s, the Soviet bloc collapsed, the World Trade Organisation was formed, and the Eurozone created. During this era, atomic weapons were scaled back substantially.

Deepening trade relations between all nations in the capitalist, and eventually communist, world made goods a great deal cheaper everywhere, but they often coincided with austerity policies imposed by foreign organisations or governments. State-run corporations were sold off to the private market in the name of improving efficiency and competitiveness. This is because the key belief at the heart of neoliberalism is that market mechanisms can and should regulate all of society: game theory and economics could explain any problem and offer a ready solution. Markets lead to economic competitiveness, which leads to economic development, which leads to a middle class demanding democratic representation. This is desirable to neoliberals, and it forms the basis of the sanctions regime which locks non-compliant nations in a straight-jacket.

Where neoliberals differ from classical liberals is on the matter of **hegemony**. Whereas classical liberals desire a confedeation of equals in the international landscape, neoliberals are receptive to the idea of a enlightened hegemonic state setting the rules of the game and enforcing them. They point to Victorian Britain as an example or the long peace guaranteed by atomic weapons.

#### Questions to Consider:

- What are the major authors of contemporary liberal theory?
- What do liberals think human nature is like?
- What is legitimacy, according to a liberal?
- What is a collective action problem?
- Why do liberals believe that cooperation between nations is possible? What kinds of nations can or should cooperate? What would Mearsheimer say in response?
- What role do international institutions play in international relations? What role would realists say they play?
- What are the blind spots of liberal theory? What is it bad at explaining?
- Is the UN a liberal institution? How or how not?
- What are the differences between classical liberalism and neoliberalism?
- Are democracies more warlike? Why or why not?
- Does trade reduce conflict, does conflict reduce trade? Or is it both? How?
- Why did the League of Nations fail but the UN has not (yet)?
- How would a liberal solve the problems within the EU today?

## Week 4.1: Historical Materialism

Historical materialism is the economic counterpart to **dialectical materialism**, the philosophy of **Karl Marx**. Borrowing the dialectic method (thesis + antithesis = synthesis) from Hegel and wedding it to an empirical study of economic activity, Marx discerned what he called a *contradiction* at the heart of capitalist economies: that workers are *necessarily* not compensated the full value of their labour. The **surplus value** of one's labour is taken and given to someone else who did not work for it – but who? If you live in a capitalist economy, it was likely given to your boss.

Where did this arrangement of an economy (Marx called it a **mode of production**) come from? Historical materialists say it comes from the feudal system of sovereign lords, who were the only one legally entitled to own property. As industrial capitalism developed, and the **middle class** (known as *bourgeoisie* in French) demanded more political representation, the right of **private property** was extended to normal citizens, who could purchase it if they could afford to. Theoretically, anybody can *buy* whatever they want – but very few of us actually can, and the theft of your surplus labour value is why.

The political philosophy of *communism* calls for an abolition to private property and an end to the capitalist mode of production. Rather than base the mode of production on the **profit-incentive**, commmunists want the workers themselves to manage the **means of production** so that society and the economy can be based on human need rather than human greed. They seek to accomplish this by forming unions, changing laws through government, or (if necessary) violent revolution against capitalist states.

Since the Cold War, Historical materialism has spun off into new philosophies, such as critical theory in Europe (authors such as Theodore Adorno and Louis Althusser) and Latin American Structuralism (such as Raul Prebisch and **Theotônio dos Santos**)

### Vladimir Lenin, *Imperialism* (Essential Readings)

Lenin is the rare political theorist who also became a political practitioner. As the leader of the Bolshevik Party, he was exiled by the Russian Czar after the failed 1905 revolution before returning in 1917 when the Czar abdicated. From March 1917 to November 1917 (julian calendar), the Bolsheviks struggled to advance communist policies within a parliamentary system; eventually, the unpopular and dysfunctional provisional was overthrown by a mass revolt in St. Petersburg, known as the October Revolution.

*Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism* was published during this year. In it, Lenin explains how **imperialism** is the most developed and advanced form of liberal capitalism, an inevitable outcome of its own internal contradictions. So what is an empire? These aggressive, expansive states which resolve their social contradictions by conquering new territories, extracting resources, making manufactured goods, and buying off the **working class** (*proletariat* in French) so that they don't rebel against the imperial masters. In order to survive, empires *have to keep expanding*; if they don't, social unrest at home will worsen. According to Lenin, the Great War between Russia, France, Germany, and England was a war of rival empires fighting for new territory to colonise; hence communists in all these countries opposed the war.

So what could be done differently to avoid imperialist war? Well, first off, Lenin didn't actually see anything wrong with empires themselves: they spread the capitalist mode of production, and without industrialisation and an urban proletariat, a communist revolution would not be likely to succeed. Nevertheless, Lenin called for communist **vanguard parties** to be formed in every country, so that the great crisis of capitalist empire be used to bring about a communist world order.

Lenin can and has been criticised for assuming that the bourgeoisie and the imperial state are always in lockstep; the century of history since 1917 has demonstrated that. States and economies have also evolved significantly since then; there are no longer any "official" empires, but capitalism remains. Perhaps a more accurate title would have been "The Highest Stage of Capitalism *thus far*."

### Theotônio Dos Santos, *Dependency Theory* (PDF)

Dos Santos is notable as an author who specialised in **dependency theory**, an economic school of thought which emerged in Latin America. After colonies declared themselves independent from Europe, many of them still retained the dysfunctional political systems but with none of the ability to forcibly quell ethnic underclasses; furthermore, they often did not have developed economies, since these colonies only existed to extract resources, not make them into goods or products. Thus, these former colonies in the **periphery** still depended on the industrial nations in the **imperial core** for financial aid, assistance, &c. This meant that **Multi-National Corporations** still had a great deal more power over **Lower-Developed Countries**, and could bargain on their own terms: this was known as **declining terms of trade**. Furthermore, liberal institutions like the IMF and the World Bank were used to impose austerity policies on LDCs.

To solve this problem, development theorists like Dos Santos advocated **import substituion industrialisation** policies This means that LDCs should begin to fund domestic companies which make goods that they otherwise import. To a liberal economist like David Ricardo, this makes no goddamn sense: if Brazil has a **comparative advantage** at making coffee, and the US is good at making airplanes, why should Brazil make its own airplanes and not just trade coffee for airplanes? (Brazil does have its own airplane industry, by the way.) To a dependency theorist, it is worth it to develop an LDC's heavy industry and nationalise its resources – specifically to improve an LDC's independence.

### Immanuel Wallerstein, *World Systems Theory* (PDF)

To Wallerstein, there are no more communist economies than there are feudalist economies. His unit of analysis is the entire world economy itself, which he characterises as capitalist in every sense. Why? He maintains that even communist states have to pass through a phase of quasi-capitalist development, and that the divide between the Soviet Union and the PRC is evidence that the communist system is not one, solvent bloc. Instead, the hegemonic capitalist system is what runs the show.

Wallerstein's work is an elaboration upon dependency theory, and it gives us the concept of **semi-peripheral** economies. These states exist on the divide between the exploited LDCs and the core nations – not just geographically, but also developmentally. They leverage their unique position to try and become economic cores of their own, but in the process they face a unique set of political challenges which neither core states nor LDCs must.

An example of a peripheral country would be Mexico (debatably): as a near-colony of the US, many American firms prefer to exploit cheap Mexican wages and set up factories there before re-importing the finished prodcuts to the US. However, the factories do not exist in Mexico for the benefit of Mexican citizens. Despite these facts, Mexico's economy is still more independent of the US than Haïti, for example, which is entirely at the mercy of economic aid from the US.

#### Questions to consider:

- Which assumptions of Liberal theory do Marxist think are unjustified? Which realist assumptions to Marxists adopt?
- According to Marxists, what is the cause of political change?
- What is feudalism? What is capitalism? How did the second replace the first?
- How would a Marxist define power and liberty? How does that conflict with Realist and Liberal theories?
- What is surplus value?
- What is an empire? What is a World System?
- What countries are "peripheral" and what countries or in the "core"?
  - What is the "semi-periphery" as Wallerstein described? What are some examples of semiperipheral economies?
- What are ISI economics? Where has it been tried? What challenges arise with it?

## Week 4.2: Constructivism

Constructivism is a very new school of thought, which spun off from European critical theory in the 1980s. Whereas critical theorists are primarily interested in how the capitalist system affects self-identity and how **relations of production** between economic classes shape society, constructivists prefer not to assume that **class struggle** is the only power dynamic worth examining. Constructivism is also significantly influenced by philosophical **post-modernism**, which means it open contests the empirical positivism of Marxism (read: post-modernists think that the Marxists assume too much about reality). Constructivists are also less willing to offer solutions to problems; to them, understanding a particular problem in depth is more useful than a general solution applied to everything. **Martha Finnemore** is the most important Constructivist author we have read in this class.

### Ted Hopf, *Constructivism*

An important task of post-modernism is to *denaturalise* phenomena which are considered normal. Constructivism does the same: it begins by considering whether the axiomatic assumptions of the various IR theories are actually sound. For example, the Realists assume that states necessarily seek power, and that anarchy and a war of all-against-all are inevitable and natural (as **Kenneth Waltz** argued). Constructivists, however, would argue that power-maximisation only happens when states view each other as "Others:" a historical example would be how European Kingdoms united under the Banner of Christendom in order to go kill Saracens (Muslims) in the Holy Land during the Crusades. How these definitions of like and unlike are created fills in a major explanatory gap in Realist theory, likewise with Liberalism.

Identity and processes are mutually *constructed*; self-perception is constructed by the creation of an **"Other"**, which gives meaning and definition to the self.

### Finnemore, *Chaning Norms of Humanitarian Intervention* (PDF)

This piece was assigned for the Post-Colonial week, but it's worth discussing here because it is a good example of Constructivist methodology. Her research studies how humanitarian interventions have changed since 1820, which she says happened because the constructed norms around intervention have changed. Specifically, the definition of "human" has expanded, but what counts as a "legitimate" has remained the same.

In the 1820s, the majority of Western interventions were to save Christians from massacres committed by the Ottoman Empire, ruled by Muslim Turks. This was because the identity of Europe was still tightly associated with Christendom: remember that the Crusades against the Saracens were to make the world safe for Christianity. These interventions were rarely led by European states themselves, because they didn't want to disrupt the balance of power by appearing to undermine the Ottomans. Rather, the massacres committed by the Ottomans were made public by **Civil Society Organisations**, usually Churches, who were able to convince empires as religious different as the Orthodox Russians and the Protestant English to help Greeks and Romanians. Of course, the English and Russians committed atrocities of their own, but those didn't count because the victims weren't Christian. Lastly, the European powers did nothing to prevent the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Turks because they weren't sufficiently European.

Fast forward to 1945, and the Holocaust has forced Europeans to confront the fact that they did *nothing* to save European Jews from the Nazis. The UN creates the Genocide convention in response, and all the signatories have a *legal obligation* to prevent genocide anywhere in the world. However, during the Cold War, genocides were committed, in Indonesia, Cambodia, and elsewhere, but none of the **Permanent Five (USSR, US, UK, France, and China)** lifted a finger to stop them. Finnemore argues that this was because any intervention would be perceived as unilateral, and the Cold War rivalry prevented multilateralism.

Fast Forward again to 1991, and the Soviet Union has collapsed. George HW Bush wants to create a new world order, a world safe for democracy, and intervenes on behalf of Kuwait to invade Iraq. Once Clinton is in charge, the US organises multilateral interventions in Somalia to relieve a famine, in Bosnia-Herzegovinia to make up for "forgetting" about the Rwandan Genocide, and makes limp gestures towards humanitarian aid in Haïti. Finnemore concludes that the norms of "who counts as human" have expanded to include all human beings, not just European Christians. Even if Clinton's gestures towards humanitarian aid were half-hearted, the fact that the question was even asked is evidence enough (to Finnemore) that more people count as human than before.

For a Post-Colonial Critique of Finnemore's article, scroll down to the Post colonial Module.

#### Questions to Consider:
- What is an example of a phenomena in IR which constructivists "denaturalise?"
- How do processes shape identity?
- Is constuctivism theoretically rigourous? Is it useful? How would a constructivist "solve" an international relations crisis?
- What are the differences between Critical Theory (Read: Franco-German Marxism) and Constructivism?
- What is "Other-isation?" What would be an example?
- How would a constructivist explain 9/11?

## Week 6: Decision Making Theories

Decision theory arose from an application of economic theory to international relations. **Rationalism** as a theory is shared between many IR disciplines; realists and liberals alike use **rational self-interest** to predict the behaviour of states. **Robert Putnam** writes a classic essay explaining how international negotiations are in fact a complex game played at multiple tables, trying to reach a **win-set** (aka set of satisfactory compromises) that will accomplish something for everyone.

However, there remain alternative theories for how foreign policy gets made, most notably offered by **Graham Allison** in his seminal paper about the Cuban Missile Crisis, and **Robert Jervis**, who uses cognitive psychology to explain why the US was so incredibly inept at fighting the Vietnam War. **Steven Van Evera** writes about how bureaucracies can fall into delusional spirals which make it hard to course-correct.

### Graham Allison, *Cuban Missile Crisis Theories* (PDF)

Honestly, just read this article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence_of_Decision

It's a summary of the book which Allison wrote based on the article. Here's the three models he describes:

1. Rational Actor Model:
  1. Identify State interests
  2. Identify threats, foreign intentions
  3. Identify solutions
  4. Consider costs, benefits, and messaging of each solution
  5. Choose and implement a solution
  6. Collect information on success or failure
  7. Repeat
2. Organisational Process Model:

### Robert Putnam, *Two Level Games* (PDF)

Putnam developed this model to explain how cooperative trade agreements work. He uses a lot of academic jargon to state the obvious, in my opinion, that negotiators representing states at an international conference also have to negotiate with their own governments and opposition at home.

Key to his analysis is the concept of a **win-set**, which is the "set" of outcomes which would satisfy the home. Each nations win-set is unique, based on domestic politics and deal-making leading up to a major summit. The "wider" a win-set, the more outcomes which would be acceptable; the "narrower" the win-set, the fewer **satisficing** outcomes. States at the bargaining table look for where their win-sets intersect with others.

But here's where things get interesting. You don't have to be an honest bargainer with your fellow negotiators; in fact, if other countries know your win-set is "wide," they can push you around and control the negotiation. The "narrower" your win-set, the more you can ask of others. Clever negotiators will use these mind-games to try and get the best bargain for their country, saying stuff like "Ah, I would love to give Iran it's gold reserves back, but the Republicans will never allow it..."

However, these international summits are often *iterative*, which means you can expect to meet these same countries again later. If you repeatedly lie or fail to deliver (or cheat), then the other states will stop believing your promises. They might not invite you to future negotiations, or if they do, they will "punish" you for failing to honour your committments. To avoid this, states can cultivate a reputation for **deliverability**, which Putnam defines as "having clear expectatinos of others and only promising what you can conceivably and verifiably deliver."

### Robert Jervis, *Hypotheses on Misperception* (Essential Readings)

Jervis wrote this essay in 1968, at the peak of the Vietnam War and anti-war Movement in the US. He lists 15 or so different hypotheses about how **cognitive biases** (such as groupthink, protagonist syndrome, confirmation bias, &c.) prevent states from making smart decisions. Because of this psychological phenomena, the personality of leadrs makes a significant difference: the foreign policy of someone like Richard Nixon would be significantly different from someone like Jimmy Carter.

He offers Five Safeguards agaisnt cognitive biases:

1. Be aware that nobody makes unbiased interpretations of new information; rather, we are inevitably influenced by theories we expect to be verified.
2. Examine your attidtudes to see if they containt supporting beliefs which aren’t actually logically linked.
3. Make your assumptions, beliefs, and predictions which follow from them as explicit as possible.
4. Prevent individuals and organisations from letting their task, future, or identity become tied to specific theories or images of other actors.
5. Always have a devil’s advocate in the decision-making process.

The example Jervis used was the nonsensical way that the US prosecuted the war in Vietnam: they had all the information they needed to prove that their strategies weren't working. Nonetheless, American leadership refused to acknowledge the truth because it was incompatible with what they understood about themselves. Information which contradicted their believes arrived in such ways that they never had to meaningfully reckon with their ongoing failure. People seek to be psychologically consistent and avoid cognitive dissonance – the way that people change is when drastic changes happen that make their previous thinking obviously inadequate. (This is known as motivated bias.)

### Van Evera, *Why States Believe Foolish Ideas*

Van Evera also adopts a cognitive psychological approach, but rather than analyse the biases of individual leaders, he is interested in how organisations themselves are unable to **self-evaluate**: rather than take criticism from within, evaluators *within* organisations are usually disregarded or attacked by the leadership. This phenomenon was first observed in businesses, but the pressures of market competition forced businesses to adapt to this. In politics, however, the only competition is between bureacracies or other states: the stakes are much higher.

As an example, Van Evera presents how the Japanese Empire's militarism blinded them to the fact that they would probably lose a war against the US, even up to the point of the atomic bombings. In contrast, he claims that the US is *relatively* better at self-evaluation, knowing to cut its losses in Vietnam after 15 years of war. (Van Evera was writing this in 2002... was he right about the US as it was about to begin a war in Iraq?)

The solution, then, is to prevent government agencies from creating echo chambers for themselves. Van Evera calls for greater pluralism in academia, more governmental transparency, and straight-forward policies which can be changed if they don't work.

## Week 7: Post-Colonial Theory

Post-Colonial Theory developed in tandem with independence movements in the Global South; many of its most prominent authors were not Europeans, such as **Frantz Fanon**, Chinua Achebe (a novelist), and **Edward Saïd** (he was Palestianian American). Many of these authors were heavily influenced by Marxism and Critical Theory, but balked at the **eurocentrism** on both the sides of the Cold War.

According to Post-Colonial theory, one of the most important events in human history is the **colonial encounter**. The moment that Europeans first arrived in the Americas, or in Western Africa, India, &c., the course of history changed. With new lands to conquer and free labourers to kidnap and enslave, the process of colonisation became profitable; capitalism evolved *alongside* imperialism, rather than imperialism being the final form of capitalism.

Over time, the identities of *master* and *slave* were constructed on the basis of **colourism** and **orientalism** to justify the rule of Europe over subjugated territories. **White Supremacy** and Eurocentrism were the inevitable consequence, which lasted until the collapse of European empires during the World Wars.

Nevertheless, as discussed in the Historical Materialism module, formerly colonised nations still face developmental obstacles. But whereas Marxists blame capitalism and the profit-motive for the continuing exploitation of LDCs, Post-Colonial theorists use post-modern theory to show that the Global North continue to view the global south as "uncivilised" and unable to govern itself without the benevolent help of the Western World. Thus, post-colonial literature "flips the script" on eurocentric narratives, challenging the assumption that developed countries in the Global North are somehow "better" at governing the world, and not just continuing to exploit the Global South.

The laws, norms, and customs of the International system were all written by white men and forced upon countries whose borders were not based on any historical or social context. These countries inherited major structural problems and sectarian conflicts which only existed because of the colonial extraction period.

### Stephen Krasner, *Sharing Sovereignty* (PDF)

This article was basically Stephen Krasner's Resumé when he got the job as Chief Policy advisor for the White House as it began setting up a new government in Iraq after the second invasion in the 2000s. Keep in mind that this guy is complicit in the US basically colonising Iraq.

Krasner writes that dysfunctional governments are so deep in the whole that honoring their sovereignty actually worsens the situation. The existing options, such as transitioning to democracy, often backfire or are not long-lasting solutions; this is because "nation-builders" or "peace-keepers" don't understand the social context of the failed state's population.

Instead, outside powers (such as the US) should offer to "share sovereignty" with the local elites of a failed state, taking over key industries and guaranteeing state security while letting the local government handle non-important matters. Krasner thinks that "trusteeship", in which the UN would jointly assist a failed state, would not work because the Security Council has a veto; thus, *unilaterally* imposing shared sovereignty is the only option which will work.

Krasner anticipates the accusations of colonialism, and argues that his proposal is *not* neo-colonialism. I think he's full of shit. This is colonialism with extra steps. If key industries are monopolised by foreigners, if the only people negotiating on behalf of the failed state are "national authorities" who don't command any legitimacy among the people, why the hell would anybody call this anything but a colony? Krasner argues that the guarantee of law and order provided by the intervener (in his case, the US) would be enough to win over hearts and minds, but consider the blowback from Blackwater killing innocent Iraqis in Baghdad in Nissour Square in 2007.

At no point is Krasner ever interested in what the people living in Iraq would have to say. They would probably point out that the sanctions regime imposed on the country throughout the '90s killed as many people as the first Gulf War and threw Iraq back the stone age. They might even mention that Saddam Hussein was propped up by the US to fight Arab communists and the Iranians. Indeed, up until 1989, Iraq's dictatorship was propped up by the US in many ways, and now that Hussein had outlived his usefulness, the US was moving to colonise the Gulf to have a permanent military base on the Iranian border.

Another post-colonial critique which I level at Krasner is that his idiotic idea of "shared sovereignty" produced one of the biggest foreign policy blowbacks in US history: the Chinese Communist Revolution. After the Qing Empire lost the Opium Wars to the West, every country in Europe tried to carve out a sphere of influence in China. The French got Shanghai and Tianjin, the British got Hong Kong, the Japanese and Russians moved in on Manchuria, the Germans got Qingdao (where they established Tsingtao Brewery), and the Americans got an entire section of the capital, Beijing. As a result, nationalist resentment curdled into an uprising known as the Boxer Rebellion, in which the colonial powers began military operations against Chinese peasants because the Emperor was unable to. The Japanese invasion in the Second World War was what finally shattered the stranglehold that Europe had over the China, and the US backed its own "nationally recognised authority" known as the Kuomintang, aka the Nationalist Party, who were in charge at the time. The Nationalists were incompentent fools, but the Americans didn't care. By 1949, the nationalists were utterly defeated and the Communists declared a new state on the mainland.

What Krasner is arguing for is no different, and he doesn't bring it up *once*. The Chinese Century of Humiliation is not the only example, but it is a good one. All of his argument is based on an opinion that the **Third World** is unable to govern itself, and that if it wants the US to stop kicking it in the mouth, it needs to open up its economy for the colonial vultures to swoop in and pick the bones clean. It's not just stupid, it's evil.

### Martha Finnemore, Continued

As discussed earlier, Finnemore is a constructivist, which means she is well versed in how identities of "self" and "other" are constructed, and how they inform foreign policy. However, throughout her analysis, she treats helpless victims in the Third World as if they were held hostage by sultanistic autocrats; key tropes of orientalism.

The way she defines "humanitarian intervention" also limits her analysis significantly. She is only analysing cases in which a foreign power intervenes in a foreign territory to save *foreign* nationals from violence caused by other humans. According to her definition, the fucking Crusades would count as a humanitarian intervention. Furthermore, this also precludes from her analysis interventions such as the aforementioned campaign against the Boxer Rebellion in China, which sought to save Chinese Christians and Americans living in occupied Beijing. Her defintion also excludes natural disasters which endanger the lives of millions, such as the Haïtian earthquake, but somehow the Somalian famine counts as a human-caused conflict. And lastly, the only states in any position to "intervene" are Western Powers, such as the US or UK. The right or ability to intervene is out of reach of any global south country, despite the fact that countries like Communist Cuba and Venezuela often export medical supplies and doctors to places which need them. Because she is only interested in military occupations, her thesis has such limited applicability that it is nearly useless. In short, people in the global south exist in what Frantz Fanon called a **"zone of non-being"**, where they cease to exist unless perceived by outsiders.

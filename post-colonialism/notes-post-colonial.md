#### Changes within the Intl System since 1945

Independence movements within European colonies radically restructured the international landscape. Africa, South-East Asia (Latin America began in the 1800s)

The laws, norms, and customs of intl. system were presumed natural (Westphalian sovereignty, etc), but the system was undeniably eurocentric. How?

1964, **Global South** countries push the UN to convene a conference on trade and development. Their most important concern was economic development, because up until then they were dependent on the imperial core, which relied on that dependency to bolster their own industries. Foreign aid was considered 'charity' rather than a historical debt which the colonisers **owed** to the colonised. This led to **UNCTAD** (UN Commision on Trad & Development)

UNCTAD examined trade between newly independent states and European imperial powers. In theory, trade should arise out of mutual *need* between partners, but the aid-relationship was *asymmetric need*. Countries receiving aid were considered "two backward" or "too demanding" to expect equal treatment, or at least recognition of equal status between states. UNCTAD's existence was a fundamental challenge to the International system.

### Other challegnces to Fundamental Premises of IR

Shouldn't the relations between nations take into consideration how and why *particular states* exist? Like, Why does Egypt has Straight line borders, but the Czech Republic does not?

Global South countries are keenly aware that they were not given agency over their current circumstances. These were perfectly compatible with European conceptions of "humanitarian concern" and "sovereignty," but this changed substantially. How? Finnemore tries to explain why.

### Counter-hegemony

OPEC, BRICS, Belt and Road – to what extent are these attempts at counter-hegemony just reconstructing imperial power structures?

As time goes on, global south countries make the argument that they had no input in the creation of norms and customs of the intl. system. Had they been consulted as equal partners, would the norms be that different? Or would they have just been implemented differently?

### The Colonial Encounter, the Other, and Fanon's Zone of Non-Being

Fanon described the hell of existing in a white man's world – existing in a world but not owning any part of the world you inhabit, existing in someone else's existence.

### Finnemore, 2003

Right to Protect and traditional notions of sovereignty are in conflict

is her definition of intervention too narrow? Achille Mbembe's idea of "necropolitics" is relevant here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necropolitics

  >"more than a right to kill (Foucault's droit de glaive), but also the right to expose other people (including a country's own citizens) to death."

Finnemore's narrow definition of "humanitarian crises" means that a lot of suffering happens outside the boundaries of international humanitarian concern. Taken in tandem with how the US causes most of the problems it solves

her level of analysis, because it's based on sovereign nation states, never gets down to the individual level to explain how interventions suceed for fail

US intentions in iraq were to build up a new regional ally, rather than establish a stable independent states. (well, then i'd argue west germany and Japan were the same thing – not peacebuilding, but just transparent ally-building)
